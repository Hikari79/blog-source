# Usage

creat a `<title>.md` file using whatever `tile` as your blog's title under the `/source/_drafts` or `/source/_posts` ( `drafts` will not be pulished).
Also, there's a template file in `/templates` , you can copy it and rename it. By the way, don't forget to change the `author` in `Front-matter` of the document.

***NB: if you try to insert images or any attachments to your document, you need to creat a new directory in the same folder of your .md file with the same name, then put all your images or attachments in it. In text, you can use standard markdown link like `[description](<blog-title>/<your-attachment.zip>)` for attachments 
or `![description](<blog-title>/<image.png>)` for  images.***
